In conclusion, adding both methods together worked far better then initially anticipated. A trend is definetly visible, that in the future this method of extracting more information from an image can be explored further. For example instead of monocular depth estimation, other algorithms could be used to gather information from supersampled regions of interest, like object detection, segmentation, etc.

With the current state, employing this methodology in real time robotic applications seems unreasonable since the low processing rate and high computational demand are not well suited for critical infrastructure like wayfinding, colission detection and other similar tasks. Still, it may be useful for offline post-processing tasks that do not demand strict time limits and can be build with more powerful hardware.

In the future this concept can be tested again in a similar manner with newer iterations of the used implementations or even extensions in the pipeline to attempt to make it more robust and efficient. For more significant results these tests can also be performed again after eliminating some of the assumptions and problems discussed in the previous chapter.
